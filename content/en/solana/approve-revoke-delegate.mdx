### Approve Delegate
Grant permission for another account (delegate account) to transfer a specific amount of tokens from your token account. The delegate account cannot transfer more tokens than the approved amount.
Only the owner of the token account can approve delegates, and each token account can only have one delegate account at a time. Any new approval will override the previous approval.

### Revoke Delegate
Remove all transfer permissions for the currently approved delegate. After revocation, the delegate will no longer be able to transfer any tokens from your account. Only the owner of the token account can revoke delegates.
