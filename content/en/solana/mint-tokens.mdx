Provide target token account and token amount, target account receives tokens

### Mint Authority
Only accounts with mint authority can mint new tokens.

After creating the initial supply, mint authority is usually revoked to achieve a fixed supply token model.
When creating a Mint account, you can specify the mint authority.
If you need to change or revoke mint authority later, you can use the SetAuthority instruction. Only the current authority holder can transfer authority to a new address, or set authority to null to permanently revoke it. Once revoked, authority cannot be restored.

### Target Token Account
When minting tokens, you must specify a target token account to receive the tokens.

Usually an Associated Token Account is created to bind a wallet address with a specific token's Token Account.
Minting tokens to an associated account essentially sends tokens to that wallet's holding address.

### Notes
When creating tokens using Makecoin, minting tokens will be included. If you chose to revoke mint authority at that time, you cannot mint the corresponding tokens again. If not revoked, you can.
