### Freeze Account

Freezing prevents all token transfers or burns for a specific token account.
Once frozen, the account cannot send tokens, receive tokens, or close until it is thawed.
Only the freeze authority holder of the token mint can freeze accounts.
If freeze authority is revoked (set to null) on the mint account, tokens can never be frozen.

### Thaw Account

Thawing can revoke the frozen state and restore full functionality to a previously frozen token account.
After thawing, the account can send and receive tokens normally. Only the freeze authority holder of the token mint can thaw accounts.
