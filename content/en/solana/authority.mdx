title: Set Authority
description: Change or revoke authority for mint and token accounts
---

The SetAuthority instruction can be used to change or revoke authority for mint and token accounts. Only the current authority holder can transfer their authority to a new address, or permanently revoke it by setting the authority to null. Once revoked, authority cannot be restored.

### Mint Account Authority
- Mint Authority: Controls the creation of new tokens. Can mint tokens to any token account. Usually revoked after initial supply creation to create fixed supply tokens.
- Freeze Authority: Controls the ability to freeze and unfreeze token accounts. Can prevent any token account from transferring tokens. Usually revoked to ensure user tokens cannot be frozen.

### Token Account Authority
- Account Owner: Has complete control over the token account. Can transfer tokens, burn tokens, approve delegates, and close the account when balance is zero.
- Close Authority: Can close a token account when the account balance is zero. By default, this is the account owner, but can be delegated to other accounts.
