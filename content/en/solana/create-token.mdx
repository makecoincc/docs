description: Create an SPL (Solana Program Library) token
---

Tokens on Solana are called SPL (Solana Program Library) tokens. The Solana ecosystem has two main Token Programs.

- [Token Program (Original Version)](https://github.com/solana-program/token) Basic token functionality (minting, transferring, etc.) is immutable and widely used
- [Token Extension Program (Token 2022)](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022) Contains all original Token Program functionality and adds features through "extensions"

Creating a token means using Solana's client program to call one of these two.

Starting from creating a token mint account, you generally also need to mint tokens, and finally display them in the user's wallet. So creating a token includes several steps:

### Token Program (Original Version)

Provide token Decimals and Supply to create token

- Generate mint account and token account keypairs.
- Create token mint account.
- Initialize mint account.
- Create token account
- Initialize token account.
- Create associated token account.
- Mint tokens to associated token account.
- Revoke mint authority (optional) Usually revoked after initial supply creation to create fixed supply tokens.
- Revoke freeze authority (optional) Usually revoked to ensure user tokens cannot be frozen.

### Token Extension Program (Token 2022)

Provide token Decimals, Supply, Name, Symbol and Uri to create token

- Generate mint account and token account keypairs.
- Assemble metadata. (Token 2022 only)
- Calculate space and fees required to create account. (Token 2022 only)
- Create token mint account.
- Initialize mint account.
- Initialize meta pointer extension. (Token 2022 only)
- Initialize meta extension. (Token 2022 only)
- Create token account
- Initialize token account.
- Create associated token account.
- Mint tokens to associated token account.
- Revoke mint authority (optional) Usually revoked after initial supply creation to create fixed supply tokens.
- Revoke freeze authority (optional) Usually revoked to ensure user tokens cannot be frozen.

### Notes

The mint account and token account created during token creation do not need to retain private keys, because when initializing the mint, mint and freeze permissions are assigned to the wallet account, and when initializing the token account, the owner is set to the wallet account. Discarding them is actually safer.

### Command Line Tools

If you have [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) installed on your computer, the above token creation can also be completed using [spl-token](https://solana.com/docs/tokens#creating-a-new-token) commands, including token 2022.
