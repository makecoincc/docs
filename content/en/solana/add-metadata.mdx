title: Add Metadata
description: Add metadata to already created SPL tokens
---

Tokens created with the original Solana Token Program do not have name, symbol, image and other information. There are some methods to add them later.

<Callout type="error">This feature is not yet provided by makecoin, but can be implemented using third-party tools</Callout>

### Metaboss

[Metaboss](https://metaboss.dev/) officially promotes itself as the Swiss Army knife for Solana NFTs, but it can also be used to add metadata to tokens.

Create a json file on your local computer with the following format:
```json
{
  "name": "Crabbie",
  "symbol": "CRAB",
  "uri": "https://arweave.net/KZDlKw8aCG4kfZtj9Qmh8tmYpH4Q287P_jmUtkl2s-k"
}
```

> The URL corresponding to uri is also a json with the following format:
```json
{"name":"Studious Crabs","symbol":"CRAB","description":"The Studious Crabs are smart and productive crabs.","image":"https://arweave.net/6mWNNDYKbn06pj9_2LxpMZA-g78F7XEPdnAdNm87vI4?ext=png","attributes":[],"properties":{"files":[{"uri":"https://arweave.net/6mWNNDYKbn06pj9_2LxpMZA-g78F7XEPdnAdNm87vI4?ext=png","type":"image/png"}]}}
```

Execute command:
```shell
metaboss create metadata -a <mint_address> -m <metadata_file>
```

### Metaplex

Metaplex has a [tutorial](https://developers.metaplex.com/guides/javascript/how-to-add-metadata-to-spl-tokens) specifically about how to use its SDK to add metadata to SPL tokens, which may be integrated into makecoin in the future.
