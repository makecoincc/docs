Solana is a high-performance public blockchain known for its fast speed and low transaction fees, suitable for building high-frequency applications such as blockchain games and DeFi. It achieves high throughput through its unique "Proof of History" mechanism, attracting a large number of developers and projects to join the ecosystem. However, it has also been questioned due to network outages and debates about decentralization. Overall, Solana is a blockchain platform with outstanding technological innovation and rapid development, but still being improved.

Makecoin interacts with Solana through SDK.

Solana has many SDKs, including official Rust and TypeScript, and community Python, Java, Go, etc.

Makecoin only uses **TypeScript SDK**.
