### Platform Positioning

MakeCoin is positioned for blockchain technology learning and communication, so the platform does not charge any fees. At the same time, the platform uses free plans from Supabase, Cloudflare, Vercel and other platforms, achieving zero expenses except for the domain name.

### Unavailability

In the future, if there is a large increase in users, it may exceed the free usage limits of the above platforms and cause unavailability. This situation does not need to be considered for now.

### On-chain Fees

The platform itself does not charge any fees, but all on-chain operations (such as creating tokens, transfers) will incur corresponding blockchain network fees (such as gas fees), which are borne by users themselves.
