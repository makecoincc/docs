### Welcome to MakeCoin

Makecoin is a platform focused on blockchain technology learning.

Blockchain technology entered the public eye with the birth of Bitcoin. Simply put, blockchain is a distributed ledger system where data is stored on multiple computers (called nodes) and synchronized through the network, ensuring all information is open, transparent, and immutable.

The "key" to each account is the private key, which is one of the core concepts in cryptography. In asymmetric encryption systems, public keys are used for public identification, while private keys are used to authorize operations. As long as you have the private key of an account, you have complete control over that account, so the security of private keys is crucial.

Bitcoin's blockchain functionality is relatively simple, used only for recording transaction ledgers. However, subsequently developed blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, etc., can not only record transactions but also deploy program logic - so-called "smart contracts". Smart contracts can automatically execute operations such as transfers and verification according to preset conditions, greatly expanding the application boundaries of blockchain.

Makecoin is building functional modules that interact with these mainstream blockchains. For example, through Solana's official SDK, we have implemented token creation, minting, transfer and other operations. The entire project code is completely open source and comes with detailed documentation. All functions are only used for on-chain interaction and do not charge any platform fees - because Makecoin is positioned as a pure technical learning platform.

Currently, there are similar tool websites on the market, but they usually implement functions through custom smart contracts and charge additional fees in the process. Excluding on-chain transaction costs, the rest is platform profit. Makecoin is not profit-oriented and is committed to providing learners with an open, transparent, and free practice environment.

Currently, Makecoin is developing token issuance and other functions on Solana. It currently only supports test networks, and will consider going live on the mainnet after the program is stable.

If you also want to issue your own token and experience an on-chain transaction, why not try Makecoin - no need to write code, just provide the necessary information to complete the entire process.
